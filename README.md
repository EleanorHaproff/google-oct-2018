## About WDD Tech It Forward

[WDD (Women Driven Development)](https://womendrivendev.org/) is an organisation founded by [two software eingineers](https://womendrivendev.org/team), Phoebe Greig and Misa Ogura, with the aim to drive more diversity in tech and facilitate the sponsor/sponsee relationships in more organic ways.

We want to achieve this by bringing gender minorities and tech leaders together in the form of hackathons and other practical events.

[WDD Tech It Forward](https://womendrivendev.org/events) is a hackathon where the focus is on the quality of the code, the people and the journey, with the aim of using technology to support communities and _tech things forward_.
